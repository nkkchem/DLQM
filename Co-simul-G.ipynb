These methods are fast, but inaccurate.  More accurate methods involve quantum chemistry, but are very expensive to compute.  Recently a family of deep learning methods colletively known as message passwing neural networks have shown to be both a fast and accurate method for computing molecular properties, including $\\Delta G^\\circ_f$ when trained on a large corpus of molecular properties that have been pre-computed using quantum chemistry methods.\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"CNqqZY16nXDF","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Metrics: \n","\n","\n","\n","1.
